Dear Home Team colleagues and valued partners,
<br><br>
On behalf of the Home Team Academy (HTA), I would like to thank you for taking time to view our Workplan Seminar 2020 microsite.  
<br>
The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation has reinforced the need for us to always be prepared in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. This is where our investment in training, such as in the areas of crisis management, leadership development, incidence responses and operating as one Home Team (HT), are put to the test. In this regard, the HT and HTA have risen well to the challenges. For example, HTA officers, with the support of our HT counterparts, have provided strong support for the Whole-of-Government (WOG) efforts to manage the spread of COVID-19 since 30 January 2020. We did the extraordinary by being the first government agency to operate a Government Quarantine Facility, housing for relocated migrant workers and a Dormitory Isolation Facility concurrently within HTA’s premises, while playing our role as the Corporate University of the HT. HTA and the HT will continue to drive Training & Learning (T&L) amid a ‘new normal’. 
<br><br>
<b><u>HTA’s Achievements in FY2019</u></b>
<br>
I am proud of the continued progress made in T&L by HTA and the HT training community in FY2019. HTA has made steady strides to achieve organisational excellence, future-readiness and global leadership.
<br><br>
HTA’s organisational development initiatives and transformation efforts were recognised through a range of local and international awards. These include the GovInsider Innovation Award for the HT Simulation System (HTS2) in October 2019, our first accolade on an international platform, and the Singapore Quality Class Star with People Niche certification in September 2019, which affirms our endeavour for business and people excellence. In January 2020, HTA also attained ISO 45001 certification for training safety and facility management.
<br><br>
Through ongoing transformation efforts, HTA seeks to develop thinking and adaptable next-generation HT leaders and officers. In July 2019, we revised our HT Trainers’ Competency Model to strengthen the development of our trainers who are key enablers in driving good and effective learning for a future-ready HT. We also enhanced our apex HT leadership programme, the Phoenix Programme, between March and April 2019 by including dialogue sessions with senior civil service and political leaders from the other ministries to impart a WOG perspective to participants, and a one-week overseas study visit to broaden their perspectives and glean best practices for organisational transformation. 
<br><br>
In February 2020, we held our inaugural Advisory Panel meeting chaired by Mr Pang Kin Keong, Permanent Secretary (Home Affairs) and comprising local, international, professional and academic distinguished members. This is a major step towards our global leadership ambitions, as the Advisory Panel will give the HT access to a broad range of deep expertise and wealth of experience in key strategic areas such as leadership development, continuous education, and T&L technologies. 
<br><br>
<b><u>Strengthening Training and Learning For a Future-Ready Home Team </u></b>
<br>
HTA will build on our past achievements in FY2020 and beyond. Our key workplans will help to ensure that the HT and HTA continue to Learn, Serve and Excel together as One HT.
<br><br>
To empower learning and growth in order to enable a united and successful HT, HTA will continue to partner leading T&L institutions and HT Departments to develop quality programmes and initiatives for HT officers. HTA will set up the HT Civilian Training School, where programmes will be conducted for both junior and senior civilian officers across the HT. We will also develop the HT Curriculum Masterplan to strengthen the HT’s capabilities in curriculum design and development. 
HTA will continue to leverage technology and digitalisation as force multipliers in enriching learning experience and achieving meaningful learning outcomes. Our Technology and Digitalisation (TED@HTA) Masterplan 2025 integrates next-generation technologies within an infrastructure grounded on design-thinking methodology, to guide HTA towards being a digitally empowered and future-ready Corporate University of the HT by 2025. Technology will also enable HTA to deliver its training effectively given the operational constraints in the ‘new normal’, such as safe distancing requirements.
<br><br>
We will implement the HTA Alumni Engagement Framework to build and sustain relationships with our alumni comprising former HTA officers, participants of key HTA leadership programmes and HT trainers. HTA will also increasingly serve the training needs of WOG leaders in the area of safety and security. We are collaborating with the Civil Service College to develop the WOG Leaders in Enforcement Management Programme, for non-HT agencies to build up their enforcement capabilities.
<br><br>
<b><u>Moving forward</u></b>
<br>
It is imperative for the HT training community to continue working closely together to ensure HT officers are equipped to meet evolving operational requirements in a VUCA environment. Second Minister’s quote has indeed reinforced this point that the HT needs to press on in our training and upskilling efforts in order to stay resilient, adaptive and agile. 
<br><br>
Thank you for your support for HTA as we continue our journey towards being a Leading Corporate University in Homefront Safety and Security. I wish you an enjoyable read.
<br><br>
Regards,<br>
Clarence Yeo<br>
Chief Executive Home Team Academy<br>
